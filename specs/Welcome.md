This vault is for VQsX.

VQsX is a modern vector engine inspired and based of Atari's Quadrascan color vector graphics engine. Its a bytecode and machine procedural based vector engine, where each instruction in the bytecode tell the vector engine how to draw.

Its like a CPU architecture that can be used for general purpose computing, except that its not turing complete. VQsX does not aim to be turing complete.

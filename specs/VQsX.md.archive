 VQsX is a modern vector engine inspired and based of Atari's Quadrascan color vector graphics engine. Its a bytecode and machine procedural based vector engine, where each instruction in the bytecode tell the vector engine how to draw.

## Internal details

### Registers and architecture

The vector engine is designed to execute programs from memory such as RAM. Its an 8-bit-worded little-endian machine, with 64-bit addressing. 

The instructions are variable-length, where the first byte is read as the instruction before fetching n-more bytes as the operands depending on the instruction fetched.

The vector engine is also a two's complement and IEEE 754 vector engine. Despite the vector engine being 8-bit-worded, it is capable of doing 64-bit arithmetic and floating point math, with its integer size being 64-bits.

The vector engine also has internal RAM inaccessible to the external hardware, that is simply responsible for storing the stacks. This stack RAM is not accessible by the external hardware, neither is it directly usable by the vector program. It may only be manipulated with stack manipulation operations.

It has the following registers that can be used for both the programs and the accompanying and surrounding external hardware

| Instruction Program Counter | IPC      | Yes      | This register acts as the program counter. Its internal, but can be used by the vector program for jump and calls. Its read-only to the external hardware, but can be manipulated thru the jump and calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Memory Start                | MST      | Yes      | This register is used to act as storage for the location of the start of the program. Its internal, but can be used by the vector program for jump and calls. IPC is initially set to MST when the vector engine is first run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| CurrentInstruction          | CIR      | Yes      | This extremly internal register is used to store the current instruction pointed to by IPC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Status                      | STS      | No       | This read-only 8-bit register is used for checking the status of the vector engine such as halted, or waiting for a NEXT signal. Its not accesible to the vector program, but to the external hardware running the vector engine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Goexec                      | GEX      | No       | This write-only register is the register that needs to be written with the starting address of the vector program to be executed when you want to start the vector engine. MST is set to the address written to GEX, and consequently IPC is also set to GEX. The stack is also cleared, and the pen state is initialized to the default values. Basically INITIALIZE is run when GEX is first written so you don't need to explicitly write an INITIALIZE instruction at thes start. This register does nothing when written while the vector engine is running, including when its waiting for a NEXT signal. |

Here are the specific details of the Status register (where bit 0 is LSB):

| Bit | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | This register is used to check whether the vector engine is halted. If 1, its halted.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1   | This register is used to check whether the vector engine is waiting for a NEXT signal. If 1, its waiting for a NEXT signal.                                                                                                                          |
| 2   | This register is used to check whether the vector engine was halted due to a fault (such as a bad instruction call and stack faults). If 1, the vector engine has halted due to a fault and not the user's own instruction or the external hardware. |
| 3-8 | Reserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Here are the important pins (not exhaustive) that the vector engine will have if its built as a real hardware vector engine:

| Name     | Description                                                                                                                                     |

| CLOCK    | A pin that just needs to have its value change (HIGH to LOW, LOW to HIGH) to clock the vector engine. It works on both rising and falling edge. |
| HALT     | A pin that is set to high to halt the vector engine.                                                                                            |

The vector engine has the following stack for runtime purposes: 

| Name           | Description                                                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State stack    | A stack used to manage the pen's state. This does not include the pen's position. |
| Position stack | A stack used to manage the pen's position.                                        |
| Call stack     | A stack used to manage the vector engine's subroutine calls.                      |

All these stacks are stored in the internal stack RAM. This means that the stack

## Assembly Language

The VQsX vector engine has its own assembler for assembling vector programs. Its not as powerful as writing directly the vector bytecode, but allows the code to be simpler.

The assembly language contains features not present in the vector engine itself, such as labels. Its also simpler as there is only one JUMP and CALL instructions; Its up to the assembler to decide which to use.

The VQsX assembly language assembler source files is recommended to have the file extension of **.vS**.

A valid identifier is any string that starts with an alphabetical character or an underscore, and may contain alphanumerical characters and underscores. **_a** and **a1** are valid identifiers while **1a** and **a+c** are invalid identifiers.

The assembly language has labels, which are valid identifiers that ends with a ":" to signify it as a label. The labels may not have any indentation.

Each instruction mnemonic must be indented by 1 tab or 4 spaces to signify it as an instruction instead of a label. The instructions must be a valid mnemonic or full name. Each instruction must be on their own line and may be terminated with a semicolon (**;**).

A comment starts with a "#" and may be anywhere.
